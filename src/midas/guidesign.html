<p>Designing intuitive, easy to use GUI's is always a challenge for
software
designers. Software designers tend to design GUI's to accommodate the
underlying
software architecture. This, unfortunately, is not how end-users work,
since
they typically don't know the tools' designs and architectures. Anyone
having to
use Lotus Notes and Continuus can attest to these tools'
breath-takingly poor
human-machine interface design. I, as an end-user of GUI-based tools
day
in day
out, have met with
joy on some
GUI designs, and utter frustration with others. So I have been taking
notes on
the good, the bad, and the ugly of GUI designs to help guide me in
crafting
GUI-based tools. Below is my philosophy on the GUI design topic:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The user should be able to focus traverse all active widgets
(editable text fields, buttons, drop-down box, ...) via the keyboard
(e.g. pressing the TAB key),</li>
  <li>Focus traversal should follow an intuitive path, similar to the
way user reads text, e.g. top-to-bottom, right-to-left, ...,</li>
  <li>When the user click on an editable text field, the whole field
should be selected (highlighted),</li>
  <li>In fact all editable text fields should be selected when focus is
acquired,</li>
  <li>If a special group of text fields is provided for entering IP
addresses, the focus should automatically move to the next octet when
the user has entered 3 digit into the current octet, or when the user
enters the dot, and remember fields that just acquire focus should be
selected,</li>
  <li>When an editable text field loses focus, the edited text should
be committed as though the user has pressed ENTER,</li>
  <li>Users should able to dismiss dialogs by pressing ESC,</li>
  <li>In a form for entering information, completing entering data on
one field should automatically place the focus on the next editable
field,</li>
  <li>Passwords should be protected with '*' echo character,</li>
  <li>Never, ever, use the GUI event dispatching thread (in Java this
translates to AWT event dispatching thread) to execute computation
logic, spin off a worker thread to do this. This way the users don't
face frozen GUI's while the GUI event dispatching thread is busy doing
hard labor,</li>
  <li>Remember Java Swing components are mostly NOT thread-safe. Use
SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to modify GUI components from worker
threads,</li>
  <li>Related activities should be grouped in the same menu, don't
spread them out all over the place like Lotus Notes,</li>
  <li>People likes hot-key shortcuts to initiate activities, saving
them from having to move the mouse, click, move the mouse, click...,<br>
  </li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
