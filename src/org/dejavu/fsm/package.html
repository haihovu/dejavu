<p class="MsoNormalIndent">Dejavu’s DjvFsm framework is a Java port of the C++
version in the Platform Services area. Some improvements were made; many of
which were results of experience gained from the C++ implementation, while
others were due to features available in the Java platform.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent">Before further technical discussion of the framework
is carried out, some terminology should be explained.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Finite state machine</i> –
    The abstract concept of one or more objects that have multiple states
    (we’ll refer to these as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">state-context</i>),
    and the framework that drives their transition from one state to another
    based on some external stimuli (events).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State </i>– An English major
    will explain what the word state means, but in the context of the FSM
    discussion, each state has two optional actions, an entry action which gets
    executed upon entry into the state, and an exit action which gets executed
    upon exit of the state.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State transition </i>– The
    act of changing states for a state-context. Each transition references a
    begin state, an end state, a guard, and an action. The begin and end states
    are self-explanatory, the guard is an optional Boolean expression that
    determines whether the state transition is allowed to occur, and the action
    is an optional function that gets executed during the state transition (only
    executed if the guard evaluates to true).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Event </i>– In the context of
    the FSM discussion, this is a stimulus from the system that triggers a state
    change in a state-context. Each event is associated with a specific
    state-context, and has an event ID that allows the FSM to identify it for
    the purpose of locating the appropriate state transition. Events may have
    other custom attributes to convey extra information to the actions and
    guards that handle them.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State chart</i> – A formal
    description of the states, transitions, and events associated with a
    particular finite state machine.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">FSM context </i>– Synonym for
    state-context. Each state-context can be in only one state at any one time;
    this is referred to as the current state.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">FSM domain</i> – Representing
    a single FSM, this contains the state chart information for that FSM, and
    has the active thread to shepherd all state-contexts belonging to the FSM
    (all having the same state chart). Applications that have state-contexts
    with different state charts will require many FSM domains, one per state
    chart.</li>
