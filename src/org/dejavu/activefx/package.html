<p class="MsoNormalIndent">This is the asynchronous communication framework
built on top of the reactor pattern. A few concepts need to be explained before
going further into the design discussion.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Acceptor</i> –
    Object-oriented analog to a server port listening to connection requests
    from clients via the <span>accept</span>()
    method. Acceptors are typically used by server applications to accept and
    handle clients’ connection requests.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Connection </i>– A logical
    two-way communication pipe (stream based) nailed-up between two endpoints.
    Data pumped into one end is received at the other. Since a connection is
    between two endpoints, one is typically the server, the other the client. A
    normal scenario is for the server to use an Acceptor to wait for client
    connection requests, the client conversely creates a connection and initiate
    the connect request with the server. Ultimately, both server and client end
    up with a connection object each (representing the same logical
    communication pipe).</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Bullet" style="text-indent:-18.0pt"><span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-list: Ignore">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Domain </i>– Grouping of
    connections and acceptors driven by the same threads (one reactor thread and
    one FSM thread). An application may have more than one Active FX domains,
    possibly for the purpose of prioritizing different services.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent">Since there are multiple types of connections, an
interface (<span>AfxConnection</span>)
was introduced to abstract out the differences in the implementation. There is
only one implementation of the acceptor envisioned, as such a single
implementation class (<span>AfxAcceptor</span>)
that also representing the interface is provided.</p>
<p class="MsoNormalIndent">Three types of connections are provided by the Active
FX framework:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="Numbered">Plain TCP/IP (<span>AfxConnectionTcp</span>),</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Numbered">SSL-over-TCP/IP (<span>AfxConnectionTLS</span>),</li>
  <li>
    <p class="Numbered">UDP (<span>AfxConnectionUdp</span>).</li>
</ol>
<span>The single acceptor implementation supports both
types of TCP/IP connections (secured and otherwise). The UDP-based connections
have no acceptor due to their inherent datagram heritage; the clients and
servers typically configure the two endpoints to reference each other’s UDP
ports.</span>
